“Before talking about project first we would like thank Masai school, Instructors, IA, Team members after the cooperation of all of you we successfully

Description of Project:

YOOX is the world’s leading online store for fashion, design and art that lasts a lifetime and beyond.I cloned the website what we learn in Masai school
during unit 2 and 3 and successfully clone the website. In this website I have to make different pages and add functionalities to respective page . We can use 
this website easily by just creating an account in website for accessing further purchase. And can add to wishlist for later purchase. We make the website as simple
as possible. During website cloning I gave my 100% to make it look real. In this website I used CSS, HTML, JavaScript, advance javaScript. As this was an individual
project I realised that only one person has to focus on every part. so, let’s talk about project now:-
